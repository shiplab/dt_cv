This repo contains two simple digital twins of model ships. The apps showcase a preliminary approach to standardization of digital twin data in the maritime domain.

## Toy Boat
The first is an application for live monitoring of a toy boat's motion in 3 degrees of freedom.

## Scale Model PSV
The second is a digital twin for monitoring and control of a wave basin experiment with a scale model ship.
